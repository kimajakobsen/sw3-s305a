In the most major businesses or universities there is a maintenance department or several. 
This department has to respond to requests from people who encounter problems. 
The request can be in form of an email, a phone call, or personal contact. 
If the problem is big and requires lot of time to be solved then the person who requested help might like to follow the process, then he would have to make a phone call or email the service employee. 
If a problem occurs often and the solution is trivial, a help request is made every time a person encounters the problem, and the service employee have to explain the same solution. 
This gives a highly redundant work process for the service employees and waste time. Time which could be spend on solving problems people cannot solve themselves. 

All these problems can be solved and the work process of the service employee can be more efficient by using the \hdesk[] described in this report. 
	
Our \hdesk[] also supports for head of departments to see statistics of their employees.
