In the most major businesses or universities there is a maintenance department or several. 
This department has to respond to requests from clients who encounter problems. 
The request can be in form of an email, a phone call, or personal visit from the client. 
If the problem is big and requires lot of time to be solved and the client who requested for help would like to follow the process he has to make a phone call or email the staff members. 
If a problem occurs often and the solution is trivial, a help request would be made every time a client encounters the problem. And every time the staff members has to explain the same solution. 
This gives  a highly redundant work process for the staff members . 
Time which could be spend on solving problems clients cannot solve themselves. 

All these problems can be solved and the work process of the staff members can be more efficient by using the \hdesk[] described in this report. 

The system developed in this report also supports for head of departments to see statistics of their employees.
