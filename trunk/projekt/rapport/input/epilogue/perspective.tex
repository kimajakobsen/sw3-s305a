The goal of the project was to create a general helpdesk which should make it easy and fast for persons get their problems solved, and in the same time lighten the work burden of the service employees by organizing the problems and spare them from solving trivial reappearing problems. Even though the problem seems real then we did not examen if there existed such a need in the real world. We did not base our system definition on interviews of service personal but based it our experience in the area. 

The system was designed to be a general system which should be usable in all kinds of organizations and companies. 

Er der et behov for vores system?
hvad kan gøre det ikke er generalt? 
hvad kan vores system ikke?
->> ikke usablity tested --> en masse ting for at gære system intuativt at arbejde med, det er dog ikke relevant.


Since the main goal of the project is to achieve knowledge we did not spent any time talking to possible costumers or the staff members of the university who is supposed to benefit from the system. From the beginning we have not assumed they will be using the system and therefore we made the requirements and analysis based upon our idea and previously experience from working at similar places. 
If did was not a learning process we would have used possible costumer to properly analyze the problem domain.
