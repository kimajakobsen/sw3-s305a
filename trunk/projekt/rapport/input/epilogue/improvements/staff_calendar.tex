\section{Staff Calendar}
\label{sec:staffCalendar}
When calculating the expected time of completion our application does not take the actual work day of a staff member into account. 
Instead it assumes that each staff member is always working, which is obviously incorrect. 
To fix this problem a calendar for each staff member can be introduced. 
The calendar should besides his working hours, days off and holidays, contain the deadlines of the staff members' assigned problems. 
It should be visible to the staff. 
This will allow the staff to easily see if any deadline is approaching. 
It will also enable the application to more efficiently distribute problems, since it will take into account when a staff member is off duty. 
%The calculation of expected time of completion of solving a problem can be done with higher accuracy when the staff members working hours is taking into account. 

\paragraph{Pros} are that the expected time of completion of solving a problem will be more accurate and the application will more efficiently distribute problems.
\paragraph{Cons} are that it requires more administration of the application, as schedules change and employees sometimes are sick or on holiday.
\paragraph{We did not implement this feature because} it is not one of the main features of the project.
