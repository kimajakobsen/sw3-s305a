\section{Dynamic Worklist}
\label{sec:dynamic_worklist}

Currently, the worklist of staff members appears static in the webbrowser, until the page is refreshed. With interactive web technologies such as AJAX it is possible to remove or add a specific problem from the worklist almost instantly when it is assigned/reassigned.
This improvement removes the need of refreshing the page whenever the staff member would like to see if he/her has been assigned or reassigned problems, as well as make it more intuitive that the member should use the ``reassignable''-feature to ``lock'' the problem which he/she is currently working on. Comprehensive use of the ``reassignable''-feature also reduces the amount of organizational problems which might occur when two staff members both work on the same problem, because one of them got the problem reassigned by the workload balancer, while the other was not aware that the problem had been reassigned to another member.

\paragraph{Pros} are reduced organizational problems due to missunderstandings. 
\paragraph{Cons} are not existing, other than increased bandwidth usage.
\paragraph{We did not implement this feature because} it is not one of the main features of the project.
