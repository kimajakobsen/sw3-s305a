\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

We initiated this project with a partly comprehensive project proposal which meant that we could start the analyzation-phase immediately. This went hand-in-hand with the \ooad{} method which the study regulation required that we used. The \ooad{} method resulted in a comprehensive analysis and design phase, which we documented immediately afterwards. We then chose to use the MVC design pattern, which -- due to the programming language of choice, C\# the ASP.NET MVC 2 framework, which took a relatively large amount of time to learn. During this learning phase, we realized that we had to redo and change a lot of the decisions we made during the design phase, as well as reinterpret some parts from the analysis, in order to use the ASP.NET MVC 2 framework for our implementation. Due to the limited amount of time we had left, we were forced to make these decisions, which not always led to a better and more intuitive application. This led to a rather large improvements chapter \ref{chap:future_work}. We did not document our developed application until we decided that we were done developing, where after the remaining time were spent documenting our application, as well as decisions which were made during the development part. We reflected upon our process and choices, and suggested ideas for if we were to start over.

%The goal of this project is to use the knowledge gained from the two courses SAD and OOP. The approach to achieve this is to make a application based upon the materials learned from the two courses.
