\section{Staff Calendar}
\label{sec:staffCalendar}
A nice feature to add is a personal calendar for the staff members, where his working hours is included and the deadline of the problems assigned to him is presented. 

This will allow for the staff to easily see if any deadline is approaching. 
It will also enable the system to more efficiently distribute problems, since it will take into account when a staff member is off duty. 
The calculation of expected time of completion of solving a problem can be done with higher accuracy when the staff members working hours is taking into account.
