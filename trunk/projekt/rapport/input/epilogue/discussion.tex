%The SAD course resulted in a through analysis and design instead of spending time learning how the ASP.NET MVC 2 framework works.
We used the SAD course to make a thorough analysis and design.
We did however design our application prior to choosing the framework on which we would built it -- namely the ASP.NET MVC 2 framework.
This meant that a lot of the time were initially spent on the design, were completely wasted as the original design could not be implemented properly using the framework.
Therefore the implementation was commenced late in the process which resulted in lack of the required time to make a full application test and correct all bugs.
This could be avoided by achieving knowledge of the framework prior to the design phase. 
In general we used a lot of new technologies which we initially had a very sparse knowledge of, however, due to the boundaries of the semester we did not have any other choice.
%The whole learning process of this project is trial and error. 
%When applying new technologies, it can go well or you can learn something.
If we were to start over, we will be able to save a great deal of time and start programming sooner, as we now have experience with the \ooad{} method and how to use it to develop an application. Furthermore we would give the technical platforms more thought as this to some extent slowed down the process as technical issues were encountered.

%Udem\ae{}rket afsnit, men synes mere det er en diskusion af vores process -- i.e. evaluering -- end en diskusion
%af vores produkt, hvilket jeg mener ``Discussion'' burder indeholde.
%Vi kan evt. Ã¦ndre det til ``Evaluation''? -- Done!
