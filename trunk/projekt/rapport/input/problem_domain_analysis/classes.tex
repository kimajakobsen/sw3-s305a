\section{Classes and Events}
\label{cap:classesevents}
In the process of finding classes and events several classes and events are found, some of which are not used in the actual program, since it might be more efficient to exclude some classes. 
This is elaborated further in the \nameref{design} part. 
To come up with the classes and events several different possible scenarios where discussed and from those scenarios we base our classes. 
This section describes all the classes and events in the final iteration of the process. 
On figure \ref{fig:classeseventstable} an early version of the relations between classes and events are illustrated.

\subsection{Classes}
\label{}
The following is a list of the classes we found.

\paragraph{Problem}
Problem is the basic building block in our application. It is used to contain information about the specific problems which it represents.

\paragraph{Deadline} The deadline can be approved or not approved and is a part of the problem. 

\paragraph{Comment} A comment belongs to a problem. 

\paragraph{Solution}
Contains state and information about a given solution

%\paragraph{Person}
%This contains attributes about the users in the application, name, address, phone number etc. We will look into the details later in the report.

\paragraph{Client} A \aclient[] can be subscribed to a problem in order to be associated with it, and thereby receive updates about this problem, for example new comments or solutions.
 
\paragraph{Staff}
The \astaff[] class inherits from the \aclient[] class.
\astaff[] can be assigned to problems. 

\paragraph{\Admin[]} The \admin[] is not associated with any other classes and is only used to administrate the users. 

\paragraph{Department}
Contains information about staff and categories. 

\paragraph{Category} Categories contain Tags

\paragraph{Tag} Tags is used to determine the problems category and thereby department. 
%\paragraph{List}
%Should contain a list of problems, we choose not to include this class in the project.
