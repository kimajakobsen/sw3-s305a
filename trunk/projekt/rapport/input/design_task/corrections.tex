\section{Corrections to the Analysis}
\label{sec:correctionstotheanalysis}

The altered version of our class diagram -- which can be seen on figure \ref{fig:ClassDiagramV2} -- contains the following changes:
\begin{itemize}	
	\item The role pattern: \\
	The functionality from the actor \admin[] does not inherit from \astaff[] and \aclient[] etc. Figure \ref{tab:newactortable} shows the new role system.   
	\item Problem: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Deadline} \\
					The deadline is now a attribute instead of a class
		\item \textbf{Problem and tag relation} \\
					A tag can be connected to multiple different problems and a problem can have many tags connected to it. 
		\item \textbf{Problem and person relations} \\
					A person can have from zero to three simultaneous roles.				
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
