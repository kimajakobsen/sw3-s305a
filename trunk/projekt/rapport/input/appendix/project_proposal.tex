The following text is the project proposal which our project is based on:

\myQuote{\subsection*{Helpdesk Software Tool (SW3)}
\small{
The topic of the semester project is to implement a web-based helpdesk tool that gives students access to all relevant current and historic information associated to their problems/tasks. The tool significantly improves communication efficiency by supporting direct collaboration with clients (students) and service providers (members of technical staff). It must support basic problem management functions such as the following: 

\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{Trouble ticketing} - each problem should be given a job number for tracking purposes 
	\item \textbf{Priority management} - it should be possible to prioritize jobs so that effective use of the technical staff is made in solving those problems 
	\item \textbf{Records of solutions} - the solution of the solved problem should be saved, so that identical problems should be cross-referenced and the (identical) solutions are not saved multiple times 
	\item \textbf{Searchable} - it should be possible to search the records for similar problems, at least a keyword based search should be incorporated 
	\item \textbf{Statistical information} - it include service goals for problem processing times, most frequent problems, creation of FAQs etc. 
\end{description}

It may also support software specific functions such as following: 

\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{Estimation} - to estimate the solution date and time
	\item \textbf{Performance} - to easily navigate among the existing solutions
	\item \textbf{Etc.} 
\end{description}}} \cite{projectProposal}
