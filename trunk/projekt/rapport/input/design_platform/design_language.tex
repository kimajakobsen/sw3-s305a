\section{Design Language}
\label{sec:design_language}

As we have chosen to develop a webapplication, we are limited to the programming and markup languages from that domain.
Besides the basic markup language HTML, the language of choice will be C\# using the ASP.NET MVC(Model-View-Controller) framework. When using the \ooad method, it comes natural to split our system in parts, called model, view and control. Combined with our choise of using C\#, it becomes a quite natural choise to choose ASP.NET MVC.
