The equipment needed to power our software can be any computer with a reasonable amount of processing power, and RAM storage together with at least one NIC to connect to the network.

We will be using a Dell Optiplex 960 with a Core2 Duo CPU, E8400 @ 3.00GHz, with 4 GB RAM installed.
We chose this setup because we have the opportunity to borrow it from our IT department at AAU.
