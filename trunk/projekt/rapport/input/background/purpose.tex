\section{Purpose}
At any workplace or educational institution the employees or other attendees will encounter non work or non educational problems. 
E.g. a broken lightbulb in a office is not related to the person working in the offices daily business. 
To solve the problem of the broken lightbulb the person who encountered the problem needs to require a maintenance officer, this is done my either calling him by phone, email or by personally attend his office. 
If the maintenance officer is busy he will not respond by phone or by attending his office. Mail will work better since it can be viewed when he has time. 
For all the methods the officer does not get a full work list with all problems and it can be hard to keep record of the work and the problems. 
Another problem with this approach is that the person who encounters a problem can solve the problem by himself, but just need a few informations. Then a system which collects all problems enable the users to see the solutions from a similar problem and use this to solve his problem. 
From this we deduct that the overall purpose of the system is to ease the collaboration between the people who need help and the people who can help. 
And the system should reduce the time spent by the people who submits problems and also the time spent by the people who should solve the problem. 
Thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the target environment.
