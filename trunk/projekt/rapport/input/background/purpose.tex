\section{Purpose}
%When maintaining a work environment different problems are bound to arise. Computers break down, printers need installation and light bulbs need replacement. Larger organizations are most likely have people hired exclusively to do this job.
We develop this application with the purpose of easing the process of solving problems, as well as distributing knowledge of how to solve reoccurring problems.
Thereby relieving the maintenance staff of these trivial tasks, effectively increasing the productivity of all employees in an organization, as they spend less time occupying themselves with trivial problems, and more time actually solving important ones.
