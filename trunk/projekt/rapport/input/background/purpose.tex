\section{Purpose}
%When maintaining a work environment different problems are bound to arise. Computers break down, printers need installation and light bulbs need replacement. Larger organizations are most likely have people hired exclusively to do this job.
We develop this system with the purpose of easing the process of solving problems, as well as distributing knowledge as to how to solve reoccurring problems, and keeping track of already known problems, thereby relieving the maintenance staff of these trivial tasks, effectively increasing the productivity of all employees in a organization, as they spend less time occupying themselves with trivial problems, and more time actually solving important ones.
