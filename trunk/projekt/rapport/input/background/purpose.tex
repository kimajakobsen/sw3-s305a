\section{Purpose}
When maintaining a work environment different problems are bound to arise. Computers break down, printers need installation and light bulbs  need replacement. Larger organizations will most likely have people hired to do this job exclusively. We develop this system with the purpose of easing the process of solving problems, as well as distributing knowledge as to how to solve trivial problems that will reoccur, and keeping track of already known problems. Thereby relieving the maintenance staff of these trivial tasks, effectively increasing the productivity of the employees.
