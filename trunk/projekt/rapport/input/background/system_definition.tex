\section{System Definition}
\label{sec:factor}
To better be able to define our system we will go through the factor method. This model contains different parts of the requirements, and it will help us derive the system definition.  \\
\ \\
{\Large \textbf{F}}unctionality \\
Our program will contain features aimed at easing the problem-solving process of service employees. Therefor the system will have the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ranking of problems
Unsolved Problems are displayed on a ranked list, depending on their importance.
\item Keep track
The system should be able to keep track of all the information regarding a problem, this being
\subitem Time the problem has been in the system
\subsubitem Time it took to solve the problem
\subitem Who has committed the problem
\subitem Who has been assigned to the problem
\subsubitem Who solved it
\subitem Feedback related to the problem
\item Knowledge saved

The system will focus on the ease of use for all users, saving and suggesting solutions to problems before a similar problem is submitted. Furthermore the system should be able to run on all systems without any prior software installation.
\item Time estimation
\ \\
The system should be able to estimate how fast a problem can be solved.
\end{itemize}
\ \\
{\Large \textbf{A}}pplicationdomain \\
This system will be applicable to different office environments as well as helpdesk- and IKT departments.\\
\ \\
{\Large \textbf{C}}onditions Users have varying technical experience. Users who are not trained to use our system will have to face a simple user-interface.\\
\ \\
{\Large \textbf{T}}echnology \\
In the development of our program we are going to use the programming language C\# together with the Model-View-Controller framework 2 that exists within the ASP.NET framework. We will set up a development server and use AnhkSVN and Microsoft SQL server along with visual studio 2010.\\
\\
The end result will be a web interface running on a webserver, with underlying SQL database.\\
\ \\
{\Large \textbf{O}}bjects \\
Problems, solution, employees, supervisors, ordinary users, departments \\
\ \\
{\Large \textbf{R}}esponsibility \\
Our system is responsible for keeping track of all technically related problems within an organization. It is also responsible for distributing tasks amongst employees and supplying statistics on their progress to their supervisors. Finally it is also responsible for enabling users and technical staff to communicate about a problem and the following solution.\\
\ \\
\label{sec:systemdefinition}
Using these criteria, we arrive at the following system definition:
\begin{itemize}
\item The system should be web-based so that we can create an application capable of running without prior installation.
\item The system should contain prioritized tags, enabling us to determine the importance of problems
\item The system should keep track of problem time, user feedback and responsibility. This will enable us to create detailed statistic about problem solving efficiency and individual employees.
\item The system should be able to save and suggest prior problems and their solutions to users, saving everyone the trouble of creating a new problem and waiting for it's solution.
\item The system should take into account, the workload of the employees and the similarity of problems, to be able to estimate how long a problem will take to finish.
\item The system should only use dynamic data, in order to run in different environments.
\subitem The system should contain a structure that can handle Problems, along with their solution, employees, supervisors, ordinary users and different department within an organization
\item The graphical User Interface should be very intuitive, enabling all ordinary users to use the application without any skills that exceed basic computer skills..
\end{itemize}
