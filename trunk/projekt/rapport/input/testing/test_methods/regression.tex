\section{Regression Testing}
Once the unit tests have been run and passed, the program is not necessarily done.
If a feature is altered (optimized, refactored etc.) later, tests should be run again to ensure that the alteration did not break any functionality. \cite{waterfallroyce} This type of testing is known as regression testing.

Usually only test cases regarding the component being changed are run, since running every test case will usually take a large amount of time.
However, we do not have that many test cases, so we would run every test case whenever a major component was changed.
By doing so we ensure that our program will never regress.
