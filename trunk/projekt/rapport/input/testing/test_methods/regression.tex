\section{Regression Testing}
Once the unit tests have been run and passed, the program is not necessarily done.
If a feature is added later, some tests might be run again to ensure that the new feature did not ``break'' any of the existing features.
This is known as regression testing.

Usually only test cases regarding the component being changed, since running every test case will usually take a large amount of time.
We do not, however, have that many test cases, so we just run every test case whenever a major change is made.
By doing so we ensure that out program never regress.

The regression tests we have run are used on white box unit tests, but upon running them as regression tests, they are black box tests, because we do not make a new analysis of the changed component.
