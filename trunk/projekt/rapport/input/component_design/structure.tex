\section{Structure}
Over all there are four components: User interface, system interface, function component, and model component.
Note however that the system interface is only used in our \nameref{sub:altSystemComponents} in subsection \ref{sub:altSystemComponents}.
This section describes how these components internal structure is.
A subsection for each component is presented below.

\subsection{User Interface Component}
This component consists of three sub-components: \cinterface[], \sinterface[], and \ainterface[].
Each of these interfaces is described in the sub-subsections bellow.

The sub-components share a login class, which is a window where a user enters his/her user name and password.
Depending on the role of the user who is logging in, he/she is directed to the main window of the corresponding interface.

Every window in the sub-components will inherit from a class called ``HelpdeskWindow''.
This class is described in paragraph \ref{par:helpdeskwindow}.

\subsubsection{\cinterface[]}
The structure of the \cinterface[] is shown in figure \ref{fig:client_interface}.
Each window represents a class and the navigation arrows indicates an association between the classes.
Each object of the different classes will hold a pointer to the object(window) that created it, so it is possible to go back from one window to another.

As mentioned, each window class inherits from the HelpdeskWindow class.

\subsubsection{\sinterface[]}
The \sinterface[] structure is visualized in figure \ref{fig:Navigation_Diagram}.
The windows in the figure represents classes of this component, the navigation arrows are translated to associations in UML.
Like the \cinterface[], the classes in this component
