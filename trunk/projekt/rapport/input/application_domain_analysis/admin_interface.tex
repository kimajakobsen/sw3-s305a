\subsection{Admin Interface}
\label{sec:admininterface}

The \ainterface[] is an extension of the \sinterface[], as the \ainterface[] is entered through the \sinterface[].
This makes sense because all persons given the permissions to enter the \ainterface[], will also be \astaff[] members.
There are two major fields\fixme{Foretr\ae kker noget andet her. M\aa{}ske bare classes?} of which the \admin[] has influence on, departments and persons.

\begin{itemize}
	\item department, including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item categories
		\item tags
	\end{itemize}
	\item persons
\end{itemize}
