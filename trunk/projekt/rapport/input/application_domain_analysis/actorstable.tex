Table \ref{tab:actoreventtable} shows the relationsip between events and the actors of our system. Note that \staff members also are able to submit problems. This is due to the fact that both "\client" and "\staff" simply are \textit{roles}. Persons associated with the role called "\staff" can therefore also be associated with the role "\client", which are able to submit problems to the systems. \\
