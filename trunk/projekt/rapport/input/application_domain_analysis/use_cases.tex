From the use cases listed in figure \ref{tab:actoreventtable} only some is sophisticated enough to be described in detail.  
The use cases add tag, delete tag, add category, delete category, administrate staff, administrate department, and \gstat[] will be omitted, since they are trivial and/or backend administration. 

\paragraph{See all problems} The use case see all problem is used by both \aclient{} and \astaff{} and works as a searchable list. 

\paragraph{\bloadwork[c]} \bloadwork[c] is the operation of the \wmon{} it checks and compares all staff members workload and redistribute problems in order to equally balance the workload in each department. 

\paragraph{\gstat[c]} The use case \gstat[] is trivial and is a list of different views each showing a kind of statistics. The use case can be accesed by \sadmin{}, \aclient{}, and \astaff{}, but they cannot access all the same statistics.

\paragraph{\ucsproblem[c]} The use case \ucsproblem[] is only used be the actor \aclient. Except for cases when \astaff{} or \sadmin{}  acts as \aclient{}. The use case is described in detail in figure \ref{fig:ucsproblem} and a use case diagram is showed in figure \ref{fig:submit_problem_use_case}. 


\begin{sadlist}[h]{\ucsproblem[c]}{Description of the use case submit problem.}{fig:ucsproblem}
\sadb{Use Case:} \ucsproblem[c] is initialized when a \aclient{} has a problem and wishes to submit that problem to the system in order to get help from the \astaff{}. 
He first has to select a category and from that choose one or more tags, he can change category and select even more tags. 
When the \aclient{} is done selecting tags the system compares the selected tags with other problems. 
If similar problems is found the \aclient{} is presented for the problems.
if one of these matches his particular problem, he can subscribe to the problem(if \open), reopen problem(if \closed{}), or use the information in the old problem to solve his problem independently. 
If no similar problem were found the \aclient{} creates a problem with a description and the previously selected tags. 
Hereafter the problem gets assigned to a \astaff{}. 

\sadb{Objects:} Problem, solution, tag, category, \client, \staff. (Department)

\sadb{Functions:} Search existing problems, compare problems, create problem, attach user to problem.

\paragraph{\ucsolproblem{}} The use case \ucsolproblem{} is the \astaff{}s primary working usage of the system. This is where he goes to get his to-do list and to solve problems. The use case is described in figure \ref{fig:ucsolproblem} and a diagram is shown in figure \ref{solve_problem_use_case}.
