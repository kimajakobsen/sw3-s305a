\section{Database Structure}
\label{sec:databasestructure}

We distinguish two parts of the database, the login part, and the model part. 
The model part is created from our Model \fixme{Link til MODELLEN s\ae{}ttes ind her. } using the ADO.NET Entity Framework(EF) which is described in subsection \ref{sub:adonet}. We choose to use ADO.NET EF because we do not have to worry about converting our tuples to objects and to make sure that changed proprties are mapped to the database correctly.  
To administrate users we use the inbuilt ASP.NET membership provider which is described in subsection \ref{sub:membershipprovider}. 
We use this provider since it saves time instead of building our own login system. 
Security is not a big concern in this project and therefore we do not want to spend time creating a secure login system.
