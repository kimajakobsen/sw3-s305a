\section{Mapping ER-diagram to relational scheme}
\label{sec:map_er_rel}

Our relations will be as follows:\\

\noindent \textit{Problem (\underline{problemID}, name, description, date, eta, deadline)} \\
\textit{Person (\underline{personID}, name, e-mail, username, password)} \\
\textit{Solution (\underline{solutionID}, description, date)} \\
\textit{Department (\underline{dept\_name})} \\
\textit{Tag (\underline{tagID}, name, description, priority)} \\
\textit{Category (\underline{name}, \underline{description}, dept\_name)} --- Note here that we have included \verb+dept_name+ in category as we have a one-to-many relation to the Department scheme.\\
\textit{Role (\underline{roleID}, name)} \\
\textit{Comment (\underline{time}, \underline{description}, problemID, personID)} \\
Note that we have included \verb+problemID+ and \verb+personID+ \\
\textit{Department (\underline{departmentID})} \\
\textit{Department (\underline{departmentID})} \\
