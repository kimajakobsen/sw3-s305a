\section{Client Usage}
\label{sec:client_usage}
The client can generally do three things; commit a problem, see status of his/her problems, or search the database for problems.
The first two are based on there corresponding use cases in section \ref{sec:usecase}.
The search function was added as a functionality for client because we assume that it would primarily be persons with a new problem who might want to search for others problems.

The following subsections describes the three usage of the system which the \aclient[] has access to.

\subsection{Commit a Problem}
When a client wants to commit a problem he/she is asked to categorize the problem in the window showed in figure \ref{fig:commit}
