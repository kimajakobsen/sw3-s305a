\chapter{Key Points}
\myTop{This chapter describes the key pointsof our program.
The key points that are included are problem searching and workload balancing.
These are chosen because they both are central functions to the entire system.
We want to search for problems to avoid clients committing similar problems and to search the database for a specific problem according to the system definition in section \ref{sec:systemdefinition}.
We have also chosen that our system should balance the workload between staff members in order to provide more efficient solving as we state in our system definition.}

\myTail{The key points presented in this chapter are problem searching and workload balancing.
The problem search describes how our system is able to search and sort problems.
The balance workload method is used to distribute problems among staff members.}
