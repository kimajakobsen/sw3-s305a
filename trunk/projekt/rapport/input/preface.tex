The included DVD contains the source code of the developed system and the tests, as
well as the SQL-queries for creating database tables with test data. Furthermore the test
results and the report in PDF-format is included on the DVD.

Group s304a would like to thank supervisor Darius Sidlauskas, Department of Computer
Science at Aalborg University to contribute with constructive feedback and technical
