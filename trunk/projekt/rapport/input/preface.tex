This report is written to document the 3rd semester project, compiled by group s305a
- Software Engineering students from Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University. 
The project were commenced at \myDate{2}{9}{2010} and finished \myDate{17}{12}{2010}
The overall theme of the project is programming. 
We have chosen to utilize the knowledge from the PE courses System Analysis and Design (SAD) and Object Oriented Programming (OOP), by designing our system using the \ooad and programming \hdesk in the object oriented paradigm.  

The report is split into six parts, \nameref{analysis}, \nameref{design}, \nameref{implementation}, \nameref{testing}, and \nameref{epilogue}. Each part consist of several chapters. In the top and bottom of every chapter there is a small chunk of text written in italic. This marks the head and tail of each chapter. The head outlines the content and the reason for the chapter, whilst the tail summarize the chapter. 

Citations are written in square brackets i.e. [xx]. The number within the bracket is a reference to the bibliography which can be seen on page \pageref{chap:bib}.

The DVD contains the complete source code of \hdesk[], a complete database dumb with sample data, the test project, and the report as PDF.  

When reference to the code are made we use special notation for this and can be seen as follows: \vari{Variables}, \cl{classes},  and \me{methods}.

We would like to give thanks to supervisor Nadeem Iftikhar, Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University for constructive and technical feedback.
