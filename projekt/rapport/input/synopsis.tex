Larger organizations often have one or more maintenance departments.
These departments have to respond to requests from people who encounter problems. 
The request can come in different form; for example email, phone calls, or personal contact. 
If the problem is big\fixme{Det er ikke størrelsen men antallet der er vigtigt :P} and takes lot of time to solve the person who requested help might like to follow the process, he would then have to make a phone or email the service employee. 
If a problem occurs often and has a trivial solution, help requests are made every time a person encounters the problem, thus the service employee has to explain the same solution over and over, wasting precious time - time which could have been spent solving other problems. A supervisor of a maintenance department might also like to keep track of the time employees spend on different tasks, so that he can spot problems with one employee or the problem he is solving.

In this report we try to address these problems by developing \hdesk. In the report we have described our development process and the resulting application.
