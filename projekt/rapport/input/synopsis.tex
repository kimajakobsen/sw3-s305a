Larger organizations often have one or more maintenance departments.
These departments have to respond to requests from people who encounter problems. 
The request can come in different forms; for example email, phone calls, or personal contact. 
If the problem is big and takes a lot of time to solve the person who requested help might like to follow the process, he would then have to make a phone called or email the service employee. 
If a problem occurs often and has a trivial solution, help requests are made every time a person encounters the problem, thus the service employee has to explain the same solution several times, wasting precious time -- time which could have been spent solving other problems.
A supervisor of a maintenance department might also like to keep track of the time employees spend solving problems on average, so that he/she can rearrangements inside the department to get a better average solving time.\\
