Larger organizations often has one or more maintenance departments.
These departments has to respond to requests from people who encounter problems. 
The request can come in different form; for example email, phone calls, or personal contact. 
If the problem is big and takes lot of time to solve the person who requested help might like to follow the process, he would then have to make a phone or email the service employee. 
If a problem occurs often and has a trivial solution, help requests are made every time a person encounters the problem, thus the service employee has to explain the same solution over and over, wasting precious time - time which could have been spent solving other, perhaps more important, problems. If trying to optimize a department, supervisors might like different statistics about his employees' 

In this report we try to address this problem by developing \hdesk. In the report we have described our development process and the resulting \hdesk application.
	
Our \hdesk[] also supports for head of departments to see statistics of their employees.
