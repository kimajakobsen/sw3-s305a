\section{Text Based Search}
\label{sec:text_based_search}
If a client has a problem which cannot be described sufficiently by the tags provided by the application/admin, the search for a similar problem could be improved by adding text based search. \\
This feature can be extended by using it as statistics; If a word is often searched for, a tag with that word might be needed. 
The admin could have a view allowing him to see often searched keywords and allowing him to create tags with these keywords.
This feature would ease the admin's process of creating the categories and tags, and improve the categorization process of adding a new problem and finding similar problems.

\pcparagraph{Pros} are that clients searches would be more successfully as well as relevant tags will be added which otherwise would be omitted.
\pcparagraph{Cons} The implementation time.
\pcparagraph{We did not implement this feature because} it is not one of the main features of the project.
