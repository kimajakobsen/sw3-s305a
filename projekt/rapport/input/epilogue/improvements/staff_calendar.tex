\section{Staff Calendar}
\label{sec:staffCalendar}
Our system, when calculating the expected time of completion, it does not take the staff members working hours into account. 
In fact it assumes that each staff members works twenty-four-seven, which obviously is incorrect. 
To fix this problem a calendar for each staff member can be introduced. 
The calendar should not only contain his working hours, but also contain the deadlines of the staff members assigned problems. 
It should be visible to the staff. 
This will allow for the staff to easily see if any deadline is approaching. 
It will also enable the system to more efficiently distribute problems, since it will take into account when a staff member is off duty. 
%The calculation of expected time of completion of solving a problem can be done with higher accuracy when the staff members working hours is taking into account. 

\paragraph{Pros} are that the expected time of completion of solving a problem will be more accurate and the system will more efficiently distribute problems.
\paragraph{Cons} are that it requires more administration of the system, as schedules change and employees sometimes are sick or on holiday.
\paragraph{We did not implement this feature because} it is not one of the main important features of the project.
