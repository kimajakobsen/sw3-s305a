\section{Text based search}
\label{sec:text_based_search}
If a client has a problem which cannot be described sufficently by the tags provided by the admin. 
His search for a similar problem can be improved by adding text based search. 
This feature can be extended by using it as statistics. If a word is often searched for, a tag with that word might be needed. 
The admin will have a view allowing him for seeing often searched keywords and allowing him for creating tags with these keywords.
This feature will, ease the admin's process of creating the categories and tags, and improve the categorization process of adding a new problem and finding similar problems.
