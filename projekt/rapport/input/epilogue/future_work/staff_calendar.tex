\section{Staff Calendar}
\label{sec:staffCalendar}
A nice feature to add is a personal calendar for the staff members, where his working hours is included and the deadline of the problems assigned to him is presented. 

This will allow for the staff to easily see if any deadline is approaching. 
It will also enable the system to more efficiently distribute problems, since it will take into account when a staff member is off duty. It will also make it more possible to make a more accurate time estimation. 
If the calendar took into account whenever a staff is ill and off duty it can automatic reassign his problems to the other staff members of the department.
