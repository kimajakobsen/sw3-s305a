\label{chap:conclusion}


The goal of this project is to achieve knowledge of the two courses SAD and OOP. The approach to achieve this is to make a system based upon the materials learned from the two courses. 
This resulted in a throughly analysis and design instead of spending time of learning how the ASP.NET MVC2 framework works.
Which meant that a lot of the time we initially spent on the design were completely wasted as we realized that it could not be implemented properly using the framework. 
Therefore we started very late on the implementation and did not use the required time to throughly make a full system test and correct all bugs. 
This could be avoided by achieving knowledge of the framework prior to the design phase. 




In general we used a lot of new technologies which we had a very sparse knowledge of and this resulted in parts of the system were we afterwards can see that this could have been done more comprehensible and efficient. 
The whole learning process of this project has been trial and error. 
We tried applying new technologies and sometimes it went well or if not we learned something from it.
