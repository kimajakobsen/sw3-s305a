The goal of this project is to achieve knowledge of the two courses SAD and OOP. The approach to achieve this is to make a system based upon the materials learned from the two courses. 
This resulted in a very throughly analysis and design instead of spending time of learning how the ASP.NET MVC2 framework works.
Which meant that a lot of the time we initially spent on the design were completely wasted as we realized that it could not be implemented proper using the framework. 
Therefore we started very late on the implementation and did not use the required time to throughly make a full system test and correct all bugs. 
This could be avoided by achieving knowledge of the framework prior to the design phase. 




In general we used a lot of new technologies which we had a very sparse knowledge of and this resulted in parts of the system were we afterwards can see that this could have been done more comprehensible and efficient. 
The whole learning process of this project has been trial and error. 
We tried applying new technologies and sometimes it went well or if not we learned something from it. 








Since the main goal of the project is to achieve knowledge we did not spent any time talking to possible costumers or the staff members of the university who is supposed to benefit from the system. From the beginning we have not assumed they will be using the system and therefore we made the requirements and analysis based upon our idea and previously experience from working at similar places. 
If did was not a learning process we would have used possible costumer to properly analyze the problem domain.
