\myTop{hvad der er med, og hvorfor det er med. This chapter will outline and present the process of using our system from different points of perspective. This is done to show that our systems usage is consistent with the use cases we presented in the Application Domain Analysis, chapter \ref{chap:app_domain}.}

As described there are three roles a user of our system can have:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Client
	\item Staff
	\item Admin
\end{itemize}

As with all users of the system, the first thing which the user is greeted with, is the welcome page, followed by the login screen.
After that, the path is split up according to the role the user has. 

We will start by presentating the Clients usage.
