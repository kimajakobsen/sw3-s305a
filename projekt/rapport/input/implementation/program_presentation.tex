\myTop{This chapter outlines and present the process of using our system from the three points of perspective, based on the three user roles. This is done to show that our systems usage is consistent with the use cases we presented in the Application Domain Analysis, chapter \ref{chap:app_domain}.}

As described there are three roles a user of our system can have:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Client
	\item Staff
	\item Admin
\end{itemize}

As with all users of the system, the first thing which the user is greeted with, is the welcome page, followed by the login screen.
After that, the path is split up according to the role the user has. 

We will start by presenting the \aclient[]s usage.
