\chapter{Key Points}
\myTop{This chapter describes the key points of our program.
The key points that are included are the complex and medium functions from chapter \ref{cap:classesevents}.
These are chosen because they are central functions to the entire system.
%We want to search for problems to avoid clients committing similar problems and to search the database for a specific problem according to the system definition in section \ref{sec:systemdefinition}.
%We have also chosen that our system should balance the workload between staff members in order to provide more efficient solving as we state in our system definition.
