\section{tools}
In the creation of our web application we use some development tools which will be described in the following section. 

\subsection{IDE}
\label{sub:ide}
The primary development tool has been Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate \cite[visualStudio], which include a large variety of inbuilt tools for unit testing, SQL and data modeling. 
None group members had previous experience with development using Visual Studio Ultimate. The alternative were Mono and none has experience with this IDE either. 
As most group members work at a daily basis on Windows Based pc's and C# is a Microsoft product, Visual Studio is the favorite choice of IDE.

\subsection{Collaboration}
\label{sub:collaboration}
For collaboration we used Subversion(SVN) and for the code sharing we used AnkhSVN \cite[ankhsvn] together with SVN. 
AnkhSVN is a source control provider for Microsoft Visual Studio. 
Alternatively we could have used Team Foundation Server \cite[teamfoundation], but this requires installation and configuration of a Team Foundation Server. We chose AnkhSVN since we already had a running SVN server.
