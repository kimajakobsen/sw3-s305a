\section{Staff Usage}
\label{sec:staff_usage}
The \astaff[] members main usage of the is to solve problems.
This is corresponding to the \ucsolproblem{} use case in section \ref{sec:usecase}.
This use case is how ever quite large, so it is divided into three steps; choosing a problem to solve, communicate with the subscriber(s), solve the problem.
The communication with the subscriber(s) step might not be applied during the solve usage of the \aclient[].
The three steps are described in the following subsections.

When a \astaff[] member wants to solve a problem he/she clicks the menu point called My Worklist which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:master}.
This shows the worklist of current logged in \astaff[] user.
An example of a worklist is shown in figure \ref{fig:worklist}.
The \astaff[] member can see the title, description, deadline, priority, and ETC
