\section{Problem Priority}
\label{sec:problem_priority}

When assigning multiple problems to a staff member, the'll appear as a list. Due to the human nature, we might pick a specific order of solving the problems in, which doesn't necessarily take priority, deadlines and such into account. Therefore, the order of which the problems appear in in the staff members worklist, is important.

We've defiend two elements which define a problems importance, and therefore it's placement in the list of problems. These two elements are the problems \textit{priority}, and whether or not a deadline is set.

The list is orderes by priority of the problem, however problems with approved deadlines will always appear on top of the list regardless of their or other problems priority. This virtually splits the list two. Above, priority-sorted problems with approved deadlines, and below priority-sorted problems with or without not approved deadlines.
