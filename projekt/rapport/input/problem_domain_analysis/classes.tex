\section{Classes}
\label{cap:classesevents}
In the analysis of the problem domain we found the following classes and events.

\paragraph{Problem:}
Problem is a class created with the purpose of adding and managing problems in the system.

\paragraph{Person:}
This contains attributes about users in the system, name, address, phone number ect.

\paragraph{Staff:}
The Staff Class changes the state and properties of problems. 

\paragraph{Department:}
Contains information about staff and problems.

\paragraph{Solution:}
Contains state and information about a given solution

\paragraph{List:}
Should contain a list of problems, we choose not to include this class in the project.

\paragraph{Problem added:}
This event occurs when a user has submitted a problem.

\paragraph{Problem solved:}
Occurs when an event receives status of \"solved\".

\paragraph{Problem updated:}
Occurs when the content of an event is altered.

\paragraph{Problem assigned:}
This event occurs when the problem is assigned to a member of staff.

\paragraph{Problem unassigned:}
This event occurs when the problem is unassigned from a member of staff.

\paragraph{Problem deleted:}
When a problem is deleted. 

\paragraph{User replied:}
An event that occurs when the user replies to something the system has sent him.

\paragraph{Staff replied:}
An event that occurs when the staff-member replies to something the system has sent him.

\paragraph{Department created:}
An event that occurs when a new department is created.

\paragraph{Department closed:}
An event that occurs when a department is closed.

\paragraph{Role assigned:}
Occurs when a person has received a new role. We later found that this event was redundant with Staff employed, and decided not to use it.

\paragraph{Role unassigned:}
Occurs when a person has lost a role. We later found that this event was redundant with Staff fired, and decided not to use it.

\paragraph{Person created:}
This event occurs when a new 

\paragraph{Staff employed:}
This event occurs when a person is employed as a staff.

\paragraph{Staff fired:}
Event that occurs when a staff-member is fired.

%\paragraph{Solution found:}
%This event triggers when a solution is 
\paragraph{Solution assigned:}
This event triggers when a solution is assigned to a problem.

\paragraph{Problem categorized:}
This event occurs when a problem is tagged.
