\chapter{Problem Domain Analysis}
In order determine the nature of our solution we have to analyze the context in which it is going to be used. In this chapter we are going to model our solution as it will be seen by users, which means we will only model the things that are going to accessible to users. We will start off by determining which classes and events we want, then we will structure them, and finally we will describe their behavior.
