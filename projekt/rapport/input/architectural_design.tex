\myTop{This chapter will present the criteria which we will use to determine what is important for our system and the structure of our components. The different criteria will be prioritized, so it is possible to determine where we should focus, when we start implementation. The \nameref{sec:components} section shows the layered architecture and the server-client architecture of our system.}
