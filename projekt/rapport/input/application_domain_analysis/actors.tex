\subsection{Actors}
\label{sec:actors}

The application has two primary actors; \aclient{} and \astaff. \aclient[c] is the lowest privileges actor, his/hers primary use case is to submit new problems.
The \aclient[] is also able to track his problems and communicate with the \astaff[]. 

The \astaff[] members are more privileged and can solve problems. 
All \astaff[] members can act as \aclient[]s if they themselves have a problem which should be addressed to another department. 
E.g. the tortoise in the IT-administrators office needs to be fed and the maintenance officer should feed it. 
%E.g. the lightbulp in the IT-administrators office is broken and the maintenance officer should fix it.

These two actors are described in details in figure \ref{fig:actorclient} and \ref{fig:actorstaff}. 
Beside \astaff{} and \aclient{} the application has another actor called \sadmin{}. 
%Beside \astaff{} and \aclient{} the system has the two actors: \sadmin{} and the non-human actor, \wmon. 
The \sadmin{} is a more privileged \astaff{} or a manager of the \astaff members. 

The \sadmin{} can manage tags, categories, departments and view statistics of each \astaff [] member, the actor \admin[] is described in details in figure \ref{fig:actoradmin}.
%The \wmon[] is an automated system which on a given time interval checks if some \astaff{} members is overload with tasks(problems). 
%In that case it will reassign the problems.
