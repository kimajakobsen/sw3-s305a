Table \ref{tab:actoreventtable} shows the relationship between events and the actors of our system. Note that \astaff{} members also are able to submit problems. This is due to the fact that both \aclient{} and \astaff{} simply are \textit{roles}. Persons associated with the role called \astaff{} can therefore also be associated with the role \aclient{}, which are able to submit problems to the systems. \\
