\section{Function}
%\fixme{Vil vi have vores sections til at starte med småt eller stort? Jeg er ligeglad, så længe det er konsekvent -magnus}
The purpose of this section is to determine the system's information processing capabilities. Ultimately resulting in ``a complete list of functions with specification of complex functions.''

Comprehensive knowledge of the OOA\&D method is assumed, and therefore we will not go in detail on function types etc. \fixme{overkill?}

\emph{Add Comment} simply adds a comment to a existing problem, making the comment visible for other \client and \staff members. Marked as an \textit{signal}-function because a notification is sent to the assigned \staff member. \fixme{Hvorfor er "add comment" markeret som "read"-funktion?} \\
\emph{Reassign} reassigns the problem from one assigned \staff member to another. Marked as \textit{update}-fuction as it updates the model. Marked as a \textit{signal}-function as the new assigned \staff member received a notification of the newly reassigned problem. \\
\emph{Change Status (problem)} changes the status of a problem from one status to another. Again marked as a \textit{update}-function as it updates the model, also marked as a \textit{singal}-function as the associated \client s receives a notification. \\
\emph{Delete Problem} simply deletes a problem. Marked as a \textit{update}-function as it updates the model. \\
\emph{Search database} searches the database of problems for problems matching a set of tags. Marked as ```medium''' complexity due to somewhat advanced algorithms.\fixme{Er det virkelig derfor den er medium?} Marked as a \textit{read}-function as it simply reads the model.\\
\emph{Create Solution} simply creates solution to a problem. Marked as a \textit{update}-function as it updates the model. \\
\emph{Attach Solution} attaches a existing solution to a problem, and notifies the associated \client s about it. Marked as a \textit{update}-function as it updates the model. Marked as a \textit{signal}-function as it notifies the associated clients.
