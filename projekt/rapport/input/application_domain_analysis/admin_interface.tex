\subsection{Admin Interface}
\label{sec:admininterface}

The \ainterface[] is an extension of the \sinterface[], as the \ainterface[] is entered threw the \sinterface[]. This makes sense because all persons given the permissions to enter the \ainterface[], will also \astaff[] members. There are two major fields of which the \admin[] has influence on, department and persons.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \paragraph{department}, including:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \paragraph{categories} blabla
		\item \paragraph{tags} blbala
	\end{itemize}
	\item \paragraph{persons} blabla
\end{itemize}
