\section{System Interfaces}
\label{sec:system_interfaces}
The only system interface which our system has is an interface to the SQL server, Microsoft SQL Server.
We are using ADO.NET which is part of the .NET-framework, to map our relations to objects.\cite{ado10}
ADO.NET is integrated in Visual Studio 2010, which we are using as IDE(Integrated Development Environment).

An alternative would be to make our own component responsible for ORM(Object Relational Mapping).
This would however take time from our actual project so we will rather use something which is already working and focus on the central part of our project.
