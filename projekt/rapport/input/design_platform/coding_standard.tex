\subsection{Coding Standard}

All functions, properties, and classes will follow big camelcase naming convention.
All private variables names will as seen in code snippet \ref{lst:sampleclass} be prefixed by an underscore and use small camelcase.
Input variables are like private variables except for the absence of the underscore.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=sourceCode, caption=\myCaption{SampleClass.cs}, label=lst:sampleclass]
class SampleClass
{
    // private variables should be written as smallCamelCase
		// with an underscore as prefix
    private int _privateVariable;

    // properties should be written as BigCamelCase
    public int DummyProperty
    {
        get { return _privateVariable; }
        set { _privateVariable = value; }
    }

    // functions should be written as BigCamelCase
		// input variables should be written as smallCamelCase
    public int DummyFunction(int inputVariable)
    {
        _privateVariable = inputVariable;

        return _privateVariable;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
