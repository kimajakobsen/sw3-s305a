\section{Equipment and Software}
\label{sec:equipmentsoftware}

The required software for our system consists of two major applications; a DBMS supporting the query language \sql[], and a web server capable of running our web-scripting interface of choice, \aspnet[].\\
We will be using \posgresql[] version 8.4.5 as our only DBMS, and  \wholeiis[] (\iis[]) --- a web server from Microsoft.\\

The equiptment needed to power these two applications can be any computer with a reasonable amount of processing power, and RAM storage. We will be using a Dell Optiplex 960 with a Core Duo CPU, E8400 @ 3.00GHz, with 4 GB Ram, Where 3.5 GB Ram are usable because we run a 32-Bit OS, Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise.
