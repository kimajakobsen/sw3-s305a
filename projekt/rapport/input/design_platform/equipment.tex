\section{Equipment and Software}
\label{sec:equipmentsoftware}


The required software for our system consists of two major applications; a DBMS supporting the query language \sql[], and a web server capable of running our web-scripting interface of choice. 
The data storage model will be the relational database model and the DBMS we will be using is \posgresql[] version 8.4.5 as our only DBMS. 
For the web server we will be using  \wholeiis[] (\iis[]). 
The language of choice will be C\# using the ASP.NET MVC(Model-View-Controller) framework. \\


The equipment needed to power these two applications can be any computer with a reasonable amount of processing power, and RAM storage. We will be using a Dell Optiplex 960 with a Core2 Duo CPU, E8400 @ 3.00GHz, with 4 GB RAM installed. Running Microsoft Windows server 2008 R2 Standard.
