\section{Software}
\label{sec:software}

Our application relies on two things in order to run:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Database
	\item Web server
\end{itemize}

These two are described in following subsections.

\subsection{DBMS}
\label{subsec:dbms}

Using an external DBMS allows us to access the data from multiple machines, making the application easier to distribute, run, and develop.

The differences which we have considered between these two DBMS's are listed in figure \ref{fig:DBMS}. \cite{postgres08}

\end{figure}

Our application use a DBMS supporting the query language \sql[] and the relational database model. \cite{Sudershan2011} \\
We choose Microsoft SQL Server version 10.50.1600.1 in favor of \posgresql[], because \posgresql[] is less integratable with Visual Studio 2010, which we use as our IDE.

\subsection{Operating System}
\label{subsec:operating_system}
We are using Microsoft Windows server 2008 R2 Enterprise because we chose to run a Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2. 

\subsection{Web Server}
\label{subsec:webserver}

%The required software for our system consists of two major applications; a DBMS supporting the query language \sql[], and a web server capable of running our web-scripting interface of choice. 
%The data storage model will be the relational database model and the DBMS we will be using is \posgresql[] version 8.4.5 as our only DBMS. \fixme{Ret s\aa snar vi ved hvad pokker vi vil bruge}

We chose to create a web application in order to minimize the amount of software the users of our application have to install before using it, in order to run this application it needs a web server. As Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 already has Internet Information services (IIS), which contains a web server, we find it natural to use this, however, we never deploy the application, and only test it on the development web server built into Visual Studio.

%We will be programming it C\# using the ASP.NET MVC 2 framework, 

%We could have used other web-frameworks, but chose ASP.NET MVC2 because we could use Visual Studio 2010 and C\# which we have all used during a course in object oriented programing.

%We also discussed not using a framework at all, and simply build everything from ground.
%We chose not do this because we assessed it is best to use what is already available, further more the framework has been developed for a long time and is therefore likely to be more effective and secure than what we could make within in this limited timeframe.
