\section{Design Language}
\label{sec:design_language}
As we have chosen to develop a webapplication, we are limited to the programming and markup languages from that domain.
Besides the basic markup language HTML, the language of choice will be C\# using the ASP.NET MVC framework.
When using the \ooad{} method, it comes natural to split our system in parts, called model, view and control. 
Combined with our choice of using C\#, it becomes a quite natural to choose ASP.NET MVC.

Further more we have all followed a course in object orient programming, where we used C\#, so we all have a fundamental understanding of that language compared to other languages, e.g. php, where some of us have a lot of experience and others no experience.
