\section{Design Language}
\label{sec:design_language}
As we have chosen to develop a web application, we are limited to the programming and markup languages in that domain, most commonly (X)HTML.
Because we have all followed a course in object oriented programming (OOP) we would like to harness our recent knowledge of this type of language. We were taught Visual C\# and we will use this because we are all familiar with it.
Fortunately the MVC 2 Framework from Microsoft allows us to combine the two, and use HTML and C\# alongside each other.
