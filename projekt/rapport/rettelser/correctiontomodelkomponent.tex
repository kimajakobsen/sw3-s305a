\subsection*{Model Component}
A edited model component is shown on figure 1.

The relation between the problem class and the solution class has been changed from a aggregation to a association, as a solution is not a part of a problem.

The relation between the Person class and the Department class has been changed from a composition to a aggregation, as a personon can easily exist by itself without a department, which is the case with clients. The cardinality has also been changed from 1 - 0..* to 0..1 - 0..*.

A new associative relation between the person class and a comment class has been created, which shows the relation between the author and the comment. A person can have zero to multiple comments, and a comment can only have one author.

A new association relation between the person class and the problem class has been created, which shows the relation between a assigned staff member and the problem he is assigned to.
